# Grove Path

OpenAPI specifications for blockchains and other open networks support by Grove.

## RPC Relays

Some of these specs may reference a public grove endpoint which has limited capacity, for the highest quality and personal use we recommend getting a free private endpoint for yourself at [grove](https://portal.grove.city)
